    <h1>Chennai Rail Museum</h1>

    <p>
        The Chennai Rail Museum, located in Perambur, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, is a vibrant celebration of Indiaâ€™s railway legacy. Opened on 16 April 2002 within the Furnishing Division of the Integral Coach Factory (ICF), the 6.25-acre museum showcases a diverse collection of technical and heritage exhibits. It features steam engines from the British Raj, vintage coaches such as those from the Ooty trains (many built by the North British Locomotive Company), and trains over a century old. Visitors can enjoy toy-train rides, explore three air-conditioned galleries (ICF Gallery, Rail History Gallery, Art Gallery), two non-air-conditioned galleries, and watch railway-themed films in a 90-seater Dolby Digital theatre. The museum also includes a Rail Coach Restaurant, an Eco Green Park, lush vegetation, a 3D mural entrance, metal scrap sculptures, cartoon hero characters seen from the train, an amphitheatre, and Natyarangam for performances. Managed by ICF, the museum offers a rich, educational, and entertaining experience for all ages.
