    <h1>Korattur Aeri</h1>

    <p>
        Korattur Aeri is a prominent lake located to the north of the Chennai–Arakkonam railway line and stands as one of the largest lakes in the western part of the city. This water body plays a vital role in the region's hydrology as part of a chain of interconnected lakes, including Ambattur Aeri and Madhavaram Aeri. These lakes are linked in such a way that surplus water from one is seamlessly transported to the next, supporting flood control, groundwater recharge, and ecological balance in the urban landscape.
